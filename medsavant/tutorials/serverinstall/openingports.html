<h3>Opening ports</h3>
<p>
	Several ports need to be opened for the server to connect to clients, download data, and notify administrators via email.

<p>* You can change the defaults by setting the 'listen-on-port' parameter in the server configuration file. See the <a href="taketutorial.shtml?tutorial=serverinstall&part=startingserver"</p>previous section</a> for details.</p>
<h4>Opening Ports</h4>
<p>
	Instructions for opening ports vary between operating systems. Consult reference manuals for your operating system for instructions on open ports.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following commands may work for your distribution:
</p>
<p class="code">
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 36800 ACCEPT;<br>
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 36801 ACCEPT;<br>
sudo iptables-save;
</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Testing Ports</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		To test if a port has been sucessfully opened, you can use netcat. On the server machine, where the 
		ports have been opened, do
	</p>
	<p class="code">
		nc -l &lt;port&gt;
	</p>
	<p>
		While that's waiting, on a client machine, do
	</p>
	<p class="code">
		nc &lt;server_address&gt; &lt;port&gt;
	</p>
	<p>
		Then, type some words on the client machine and hit enter/return. If the port is open, the server
		will echo the words you typed on the client.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Once the server is running and ports are opened, you'll be able to start administrating the installation
	through the MedSavant client. Proceed to the Administration tutorial for instructions.
