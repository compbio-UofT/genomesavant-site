<h3>Creating a project</h3>
<p>
	In order to start using MedSavant, you'll need to create a database and a project. A database may contain 
	multiple projects. Let's start by creating a database.
</p>
<h5>Creating a MedSavant Database</h5>
<p>
	Open the MedSavant client. Click the <b>Create Database</b> button. Enter the appropriate connection information, 
	including administrator credentials. Make up an appropriate <b>database name</b>. This can't be changed after creation. 
	Click the <b>Create</b> button when ready.

<p>
	A database will be created on the server. Be patient, it takes about a minute.
</p>
<h5>Creating a MedSavant Project</h5>
<p>
	Login using the same connection information used to create the database. Since this is the first time
	logging into the database, you'll be prompted to create a project. You'll proceed through the project creation
	wizard.

<p>
	You will need to provide some information to customize your project:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Project Name - a unique name for the project (e.g. "Autism Exome Project")</li>
	<li>Individuals - what information to store about patients</li>
	<li>Custom VCF Fields - what information from the INFO field to parse and make searchable</li>
	<li>Reference - the reference genome variants refer to</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Continue through the wizard, clicking <b>Create Project</b> when ready.
</p>
<p>
	After your project has been created, you can login and start using MedSavant. Proceed to the 
	Administration tutorial to learn how to add users and to modify projects.
