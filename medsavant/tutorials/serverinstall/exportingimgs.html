<h3>Exporting Savant Images</h3>
<p>
While screenshots are nice, they contain a lot of superfluous content (e.g. buttons and menus) which don't need to be included. Savant has an export option that saves only the relevant track information to an image file for you to use in presentations or publications. 
</p>
<p>
Once you've found an region of interest, you can export it into a succinct image by choosing <b>File &gt; Export Track Images ...</b>. Select tracks to include one-by-one by using the <strong>&gt;</strong> button, or press the <b>&gt; &gt;</b> button to include all tracks. Press <b>Ok</b>. Finally, <b>specify a file name (including the .png extension)</b> and press <b>Save</b>.

	Congratulations, you're now finished with the basics!
