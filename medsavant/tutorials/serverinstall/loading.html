<h3>Loading a Genome</h3>
<p>
	Savant requires that a genome be loaded before tracks.
</p>
<p>
	For the remainder of this tutotial, we will be using the human reference genome <strong>hg19</strong>. Load this genome as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	Click <b>File &gt; Load a Genome</b>.
</li>
<li>
	Select <b>Published Genome</b>: this option is appropriate when the genome you are working with is found  in the dropdown list of published genomes. For some genomes, you can simultaneously open related tracks e.g. a gene track.
</li>
<li>
	Select the <b>Human - Feb. 2009 (GRCh37/hg19)</b> from the dropdown (if it's not already selected).
</li>
<li>
	Check the <b>Refseq genes</b> checkbox. Click <b>OK</b>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If there is some genome that you would like to load, but is not listed in the Load Genome dialog, please let us know. 
	You can always alternatively load a genome in FASTA format by clicking File > Load Genome from File.
</p>

<h3>Loading Tracks</h3>
<p>
	Savant can load data that's stored a various formats, including BAM, VCF, BED, GFF, and WIG. Some of these 
	files may need to be specially formatted, however, so that you can browse them quickly. BAM files do not need to 
	be formatted, although they are required to be sorted (using Samtools sort function) and have an index with extension .bai
	in the same directory as the file with extension .bam. Upon requesting a file to be loaded through <strong>File > Load Track from File...</strong>, Savant 
	will either load it if previously formatted or prompt you to format it. For now, let's instead try loading tracks from URL.
</p>
<p>
	Savant can load tracks from web servers, provided the full URL to a previously formatted track. Below is a link to 
	a read alignments file that is hosted on our web servers. Copy the full URL, then load it using <strong>File > Load Track from URL...</strong>.
	Paste the URL in the ensuing dialog and click <strong>OK</strong>.

	We cover what this track contains in the HTS tutorial, for now it's only important that you can load remote tracks.
