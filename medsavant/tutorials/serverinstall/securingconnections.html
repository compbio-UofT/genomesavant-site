<h3>Securing Connections using SSL</h3>
<p>
	If you will be connecting to a MedSavant server outside of your private network, and the data hosted 
	by your server is sensitive it is highly recommended to set up SSL encryption to ensure secure transfer of 
	data.
</p>
<h4>Creating a public-private key pair</h4>
<blockquote>
	<h5>Create the Server Key</h5>
	<p>
		Create a self-signed server key by typing the following on the command line
	</p>
	<p class="code">
		keytool -genkey -v -keyalg RSA -keystore server.keystore -validity 36500 -dname "CN=Server, OU=Production, O=University of Toronto, L=Toronto, ST=Ontario, C=Canada"
	</p>
	<p>
		The -validity argument specifies how long the key is valid for, in days.
	</p>
	<p>
		The -dname argument specifies the distinguished name for a certificate associated with the key. The six parameters have the following significance:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>CN - Common Name of the certificate owner</li>
		<li>OU - Organizational Unit of the certificate owner</li>
		<li>O - Organization to which the certificate owner belongs</li>
		<li>L - Locality name of the certificate owner</li>
		<li>S - State or province of the certificate owner</li>
		<li>C - Country of the certificate owner</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Adjust these as appropriate, but keep CN=Server
	</p>
	<p>
		You will be prompted to enter a password. Remember it, we'll need it later.
	</p>
	<h5>Create the Client Key</h5>
	<p>
		Create a self-signed client key by typing the following on the command line
	</p>
	<p class="code">
		keytool -genkey -v -keyalg RSA -keystore client.keystore -validity 36500 -dname "CN=Client, OU=Production, O=University of Toronto, L=Toronto, ST=Ontario, C=Canada"
	</p>
	<p>
		Again, edit the -dname parameters as necessary, leaving CN=Client
	</p>
