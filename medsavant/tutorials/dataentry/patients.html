<h3>Managing Patients and Cohorts</h3>
<p> 
After logging into MedSavant, or clicking the 'Project' section, a summary will be displayed for the current project indicating the number of individuals and cohorts.  Additional
patients (individuals) and cohorts can be added via the 'Patients' and Cohorts subsections, respectively, from this section. 
</p>
<h4>Adding and Removing Patients</h4>
<p>Patients can be added manually, one at a time by clicking the <img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/dataentry/icons/mac_add.png" /> icon near the bottom left of the MedSavant window.  This pops up the 
"Add Patient" window, containing various fields, all of which are optional except the Hospital ID, that can be filled out.  Some fields - including DNA ID(s), BAM URL(s), and Phenotypes 
support multiple values, which should be separated by new lines.  BAM URL(s) should be prefixed with the appropriate protocol -- e.g. http:// or https://.  After adding an 
individual, the hospital ID for that individual will be listed in the left pane, and selecting that identifier will display the record for that individual. Individuals may also be removed
by clicking the <img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/dataentry/icons/mac_remove.png" /> icon located near the bottom left of the MedSavant window.   </p>

<!-- Pedigrees -->
<p>Selecting an individual in in the left pane will load the corresponding record in the right pane.  In addition to basic patient information, the pedigree for the patient can be viewed
by clicking the 'Show' button beside 'Pedigree'.  Pedigrees are generated based on the Family ID, Hospital ID, and IDs of the mother and father.  Specifically, a node in the pedigree graph 
is created for each individual that has the same the Family ID of the selected patient, and an edge links two family members whenever the hospital ID of the parent matches the "ID of Mother"
or "ID of Father" field associated with the child (<span class="ref" id="pedigree"></span>).  Two buttons in the upper right of the pedigree graph allow the font size to be increased 
(<img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/dataentry/icons/font_increase.png" />) or decreased (<img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/dataentry/icons/font_decrease.png" />). </p>

<h4>Importing and Exporting Patients</h4>
<p>
Patients may also be exported or imported to or from a file of commas separated values (.csv file), which can be read and written from most database and spreadsheet programs, including 
Excel. To export a file, click the <img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/dataentry/icons/export.png" /> button near the bottom left of the MedSavant window, after which you will be prompted for a filename.   which are typically exported by a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel) or database program.  The CSV file 
For importing, a .csv file may contain records for multiple patients, one per row, and must contain at a minimum the following columns:   </p>

<table>
<tr><th>Column Title</th><th>Required?</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>family_id</td><td>N</td><td>The family identifier.  Only individuals matching this identifier will appear in the pedigree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>hospital_id</td><td>Y</td><td>The Hospital identifier.  Individuals with the same family ID as this patient, and that refer to this hospital ID as a father or mother will appear as children in the pedigree graph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>idbiomom</td><td>N</td><td>Identifier of patient's mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>idbiodad</td><td>N</td><td>Identifier of patient's father.</td></tr>
<tr><td>gender</td><td>N</td><td>The gender of the patient, specified as an integer where 0: unspecified, 1: Male, 2: Female. </td></tr>
<tr><td>affected</td><td>N</td><td>Set to "true" if this patient is affected by <span style="color: red;">???</span>, or "false" otherwise</td></tr>
<tr><td>dna_ids</td><td>N</td><td>A semicolon-delimited list of DNA Identifiers for the sequences associated with this patient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>bam_url</td><td>N</td><td>A semicolon-delimited list of URLs to the BAM files associated with this patient. (Click <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">here</a> for .bam format specifications)</td></tr>
<tr><td>phenotypes</td><td>N</td><td>A semicolon-delimited list of phenotypes observed in this individual.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Most fields are optional, and if information is not available they can be left blank.  If one of the optional fields is always missing -- for example, you may not know the BAM 
urls for any of the patients -- the column will still be required, though each entry will be blank.  Also, in addition to the above fields, your administrator may have 
defined other fields to be associated with patients, and these fields must be defined in the .csv also.  A sample .csv file is 
available <a href="./tutorials/dataentry/sample_patients.csv">here</a></p>  

<h4>Adding Patients to a Cohort</h4>
<p>
Patients can be added to a Cohort by selecting one or more individuals within the "Patients" subsection, and then clicking "Assign individual(s) to Cohort" 
(<span class="ref" id="pedigree" />). The Cohorts themselves are created in a separate "Cohorts" subsection, within the "Project" section.  In this subsection, you can add and delete 
Cohorts by clicking the <img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/dataentry/icons/mac_add.png" /> or <img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/dataentry/icons/mac_remove.png" /> icons, 
respectively, both located towards the lower left of the MedSavant window (<span id="ref" class="cohort"></span>).  Clicking any Cohort in the left pane will display the members of that Cohort in the right pane.  To remove 
an individual from a Cohort, click the <img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/dataentry/icons/mac_remove.png" /> icon immediately below the list of users.
