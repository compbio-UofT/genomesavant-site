	There are three main sections in MedSavant (four for administrators):
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Project</strong> displays summary information about your project</li>
	<li><strong>Table</strong> lists and allows management of database contents</li>
	<li><strong>Variants</strong> supports the filtration, visualization, and analysis of genetic variants</li>
	<li><strong>Administrator</strong> enables administrative management of the database and project</li>
</ul>
<p>
	These sections are listed as gray links along the top of the window. Each section has one or more subsections.
	Subsections for the active section are listed along the left side of the window. We will explore the features 
	of the various sections and subsections in the other tutorials. For now, click around to gain an understanding 
	of how the program is organized.
