<h3>Creating a Database</h3>
<p>
	In order to start using MedSavant, you'll need to create a database in which projects reside. A database may contain 
	multiple projects. A server may contain multiple databases, too.
</p>
<h5>Creating and Configuring a Database</h5>
<p>
	Open the MedSavant client. Click the <b>Create Database</b> button. Enter the appropriate connection information, 
	including administrator credentials. Make up an appropriate <b>database name</b>. This can't be changed after creation. 
	Click the <b>Create</b> button when ready.

	A database will be created on the server. Be patient, it takes about a minute. Once the database is created, you
	can login. The first time you do, you'll be prompted to create a project, which is discussed in the next section.
