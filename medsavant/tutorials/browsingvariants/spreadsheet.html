<h3>Browsing the Spreadsheet</h3>
<p>To view the variants matching the current search criteria -- or all variants if no search filters have been applied -- click on the "Spreadsheet" subsection within the "Variants" section, and then click the "Load Spreadsheet"
button in the main pane towards the center of the MedSavant window.  Each variant is listed as a row in a spreadsheet, with each column representing a different attributes.  The attributes (columns) that are visible can be changed clicking the "More Fields" button, located at the top centre, just above the spreadsheet.   The results are displayed over a series of pages, each showing 500 results.  Within each page, these results can be filtered by clicking the drop-down menu beside each column header, and selecting the value to filter on.  For example, selecting the "G" option from the "Reference" column, will restrict the current page of results to show only those rows corresponding to variants with a Reference value of "G".  Clicking the column headers themselves will change the sort order for the current page for the attribute.</p>

<h4><a id="VariantInspector">Variant Inspector</a></h4>
<p>The "Inspector" is a powerful feature found in the Spreadsheet subsection and elsewhere within the "Variants" section of MedSavant.  The Inspector can be accessed by clicking the "Inspector" button, located near the top of the MedSavant window just below the section selection button bar.  Clicking this displays a panel to the right showing information about the selected variant including <b>Basic Variant Information</b>: i.e. the chromosomal position, Reference and Alternate nucleotides, type of mutation, and a drop-down list of Genes associated with the position (<span class="ref" id="basicvar"> </span>). </p>

<div class="caption" id="basicvar">
	Example of the "Inspector" view for the selected position 12,009,911 on Chromosome 1.  Clicking the 'Show' button displays additional information including DP, AF1, AC1, DP4, MQ, FQ, and PV4. <span style="color:red">Marc: Insert text here</span>.  
</div>

<p>Just below the variant information is a textbox where comments can be viewed and edited for this variant, and below that is a list of individuals that possess any variant at the selected position.  Clicking any of these individuals will display the particular polymorphism, insertion, or deletion associated with that individual.  Then, clicking the 'Show' button will de-select the currently selected variant, and load the variant corresponding to the selected individual into the inspector (<span class="ref" id="indswithvariant"></span>, right side).  Below this are two buttons that launch a hierarchical display of the variants at this position, organized by Cohort or Family (<span class="ref" id="indswithvariant"></span>, left side).  In this way, one can see at a glance which variants are over-represented within a Cohort or family, or relative to the entire database of DNA sequences.  </p>

<p>An example of this display that is shown in response to clicking on the "Varaints at this position by Cohort" button is shown in <span class="ref" id="indswithvariant"></span>.  The displayed table consists of a number of collapsible rows, and a column DNA ID that always displays the number of variants associated with the rows that have been collapsed.  For example, clicking the  <img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/browsingvariants/icons/collapse.png" /> icon beside Cohort B would display 3 / 6 (0.5) in the DNA ID column -- indicating that there are three distinct DNA IDs that have a variant at position 12,009,911 (as shown in the title above the table), and which belong to Cohort B.  If instead one were to click the <img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/browsingvariants/icons/collapse.png" /> icon beside Fam2 under "All Individuals", the DNA ID column would show 2/110 (0.02) -- indicating that 2 of 110 individuals possess a variant at position 12,009,911, and belong to the family identified by "Fam2".  Since we have selected "Variants at this Position by Cohort", the denominator in each fraction always represents the total number of individuals within the corresponding Cohort, or -- if the row is a member of the "All Individuals" Cohort, the total number of individuals regardless of Cohort.  Similarily, clicking the "Variants at this position by Family" button will generate a table as in <span class="ref" id="indswithvariant"></span>, except that the family ID column will precede the Cohort column, and all denominators will be the total number of individuals in the corresponding family.  In both cases, the first and last columns are fixed, but the remaining columns can be dragged left and right to change how items are grouped in the table. </p>

The <img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/browsingvariants/icons/inspector2.png" /> button will immediately load the corresponding variant and DNA ID into the Inspector.

<h4><a id="GeneInspector">Gene Inspector</a></h4>
<p> The Gene Inspector can be launched by clicking the "Gene" tab of the inspector, or via the <img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/browsingvariants/icons/inspector2.png" /> button in <span class="ref" id="basicvar"></span>.  This inspector is organized into four sub-panels of information: "Gene Details", "Individuals with a variant in this gene", "Ontology", and "Related Genes".  The "Gene Details" section contains basic information including the name of the gene, its chromosomal position, and its DNA sequence length (<span style="color:red;">exons only?</span>) (<span class="ref" id="inspector_gene"></span>).  Immediately below, the "Individuals with a variant in this gene" section lists all individuals that possess any type of variant that lies within the range delimited by the start and end of this Gene's sequence.  Clicking any individual will bring up a summary of the variants that individual possesses.  In <span class="ref" id="inspector_gene"></span>, the individual with sequence identifier DB_MD_244_M9-1 has three heterozygous insertions <span style="color:red">(are these meaningful?  only spaced by 1-2 nucleotides)</span> at various positions within this gene (PRDM2).  Clicking the <img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/browsingvariants/icons/expand.png" /> icon beside any of the listed variants provides additional detail on the Reference and Alternate sequences for that variant.

<p>Similar to the Cohort and Family analysis tools in the previous <a href="#VariantInspector">Variant Inspector</a> section, the Gene Inspector section also includes two buttons to view the frequency with which variants occur in the selected gene by Cohort or by Family.  These work similarily to those in the previous section, but include an additional 'Position' column, as <b>all</b> variants for the selected gene are shown (<span class="ref" id="genecohortanalysis" /></span>).</p>

<h4><a id="GeneMANIA">GeneMANIA</a></h4>
<p>MedSavant includes built-in support for the GeneMANIA prediction algorithm, to predict genes that are functionally similar to one or more selected genes based on multiple sources of biological evidence including physical protein-protein interactions, genetic interactions, co-expression, co-localization, shared domains, and various other data sources described at the <a href="http://genemania.org">GeneMANIA</a> website. The first time you run MedSavant, the GeneMANIA data (currently ~600MB) will need to be downloaded, requiring an active internet connection.  In this case, the "Related Genes" section will only include a 'Download GeneMANIA' button that will download the data, extract, and install it automatically.  After clicking the button, the download and installation will take place in the background (you can monitor its progress by clicking the 'Jobs' in the upper right of the MedSavant window).  Once GeneMANIA is installed, the "Related Genes" section will always be populated with the GeneMANIA prediction results, and you will not need to repeat the download step.</p>

<p> Each GeneMANIA prediction is listed in descending order of similarity to the selected query gene, so that the most similar genes are listed first.  The variation frequency, listed beside each gene, displays the fraction of variant positions per kilobase (<span style="color:red;">Is this right?</span>), and several buttons as summarized in <span class="ref" id="genemania"></span>.</p>
