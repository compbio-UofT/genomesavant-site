<h3>Visualizing Trends</h3>
MedSavant includes charting tools to explore the variant database through the construction of histograms.  These tools are located in the "Variants" section, under the subsection "Charts".  <span class="ref" id="chart"></span> shows the main features.  Each chart is a graph of the distribution of a particular variant attribute -- e.g. its position, reference/alternate value, gender of the individual from which it was identified, or DNA identifier -- among the variants that were returned by the current search.  The variable of interest can be changed via the "Chart" drop-down menu in the upper left portion of the chart display.  </p>

<p>The selected attribute can be further grouped by another secondary attribute, selected via the "Group by" drop-down menu towards the upper right of the chart display.  Grouping by a second attribute introduces a legend, and plots a separate histogram for each distinct value of the secondary attribute (<span class="ref" id="chartgb"></span>).  By default, continuous attributes are "binned" (discretized) into equal ranges pre-selected for that attribute (<span style="color: red">Marc: add more on how this is done?</span>).  When graphing a single attribute, checkboxes at the bottom of the chart can be used to display a pie chart, sort categorical attributes by frequency (so that the most frequent categories are left-most), or convert the X or Y-axis to a log scale. The option "show original frequencies" will display the frequencies of each bin within the entire database of variants, overlaid on the histogram calculated on the current search results.</p>
