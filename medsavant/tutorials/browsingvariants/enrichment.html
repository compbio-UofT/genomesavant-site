<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>The final subsection of the "Variants" subsection, "Analytics", is bundled with two Apps for further analyses of the variant data: Enrichment, and Family Matters.</p>
<h4>Finding Enrichment</h4>
<p>The enrichment analysis App counts the number of variants with a particular property, similar to the charting tool covered in the <a href="Visualizing.Trends.html">previous tutorial</a>.  However, the properties supported by the Enrichment app are loaded from external databases and take longer to compute.  Variants may be aggregated based on a <a href="#">Region List</a>, Family, Cohort, or Ontology.  To demonstrate, consider an analysis based on the gene ontology (GO), performed by choosing "Ontology" from the "Aggregate varaints by" drop-down near the top left of the Enrichment App pane, and then choosing "GO - Gene Ontology" from the Ontology drop-down (<span class="ref" id="enrichment"></span>).  This presents a table of expandable rows that functions similarily to that of the Family and Cohort tools found in the <a href="Browsing.the.Spreadsheet.html">Spreadsheet section</a>.  Each row can be expanded (<img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/browsingvariants/icons/expand.png" />) or collapsed (<img class="inline_icon" src="./tutorials/browsingvariants/icons/collapse.png" />) to navigate the GO Hierarchy, and the total number of variants that occur within genes possessing the corresponding annotation in each row is given in the "Variant Count" column.  </p>

<P>In addition to the GO ontology, MedSavant includes support for the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) databases of gene-disease associations.</p>
