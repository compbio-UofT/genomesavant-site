<h3>Experimenting with plugins</h3>
<p>
Savant is rather unique in in its ability to incorporate plugins. Plugins can fall into many categories:
</p>
<ul>

<p>
<b>Datasource</b>: enable access to an external datasource (e.g. UCSC and 1000 Genomes)
</p>
<p>
<b>Analytics</b>: perform custom analytics in realtime (e.g. Cufflinks)
</p>
<p>
<b>Visualization</b>: display custom graphics on top of tracks (e.g. SNP Finder)
</p>
<p>
<b>More</b> (e.g. Table View)
</p>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
Plugins can be installed directly from within Savant. To do so, open the Plugin Manager by choosing <b>Plugins &gt; Plugin Manager &gt; Install from Repository</b>. The repository contains an updated list of plugins that are available for various versions of Savant.
</p>
<p>
Here is a list of plugins that work with the version of Savant used in this lab:
</p>
<ul>

<p>
Chromatogram -	Shows Sanger sequencing chromatograms overlaid on the reference genome
</p>
<p>
edgeR -	Detects and visualizes differential enrichment from RNA-seq or ChIP-seq data
</p>
<p>
Data table -	Shows textual data from track records in tabular form
</p>
<p>
GATK -	Predicts and visualizes genotypes from read alignment tracks
</p>
<p>
Gene ontology -	Guides navigation based on ontology terms
</p>
<p>
PING -	Guides navigation based on proteinâ€“protein interaction databases
</p>
<p>
Remote commander -	Issue navigation and other commands remotely through external tools
</p>
<p>
Ribosome -	Shows the amino acid translation of gene tracks
</p>
<p>
RNA-seq analyzer -	Reconstructs and estimates isoforms from RNA-seq data
</p>
<p>
SimpleSNP -	Predicts and visualizes SNVs from read alignment tracks
</p>
<p>
Snapshot -	Exports track images at every bookmarked genomic region
</p>
<p>
SRMA -	Realigns HTS read alignments
</p>
<p>
UCSC explorer -	Provides a graphical interface for loading UCSC tracks
</p>
<p>
WikiPathways -	Guides navigation based on biological pathways
</p>
</ul>

<p>
Experiment with plugins of interest. A simple exercise with the UCSC plugin is described below.
