<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>
	In the previous part you loaded the hg19 sequence and a gene track. The tracks are stacked on top of each other. You can likely identify which track is which by consulting the track path printed on the <b>Title Bar</b> of each track. You'll notice that the sequence track is completely gray, since this assembly has been padded at the beginning with 10,000 N's. Navigate to <b>chr1:10,000-11,000</b> by entering this into the location field (in the top-left corner of the interface) and clicking <b>Go</b>.

</p>
<p>
	Savant displays the sequence of letters in a genome as a sequence of colours (e.g. A = blue). This makes repetitive sequences, like the ones found at the start of this region, easy to identify.
</p>
<p>
	Besides using the location bar, navigation is possible in Savant in many ways:
</p>
<h4>By navigation buttons</h4>
<p>
	Buttons for <b>zooming in and out</b> and <b>panning left and right</b> are located in the top-right of the interface. Experiment with them. You can also <b>undo and redo navigation steps</b> by using the yellow and green icons, respectively.
</p>

</p>
<h4>By mouse and keyboard shortcuts</h4>
<p>
	A number of <a href="docs/SavantShortcuts.pdf">mouse and keyboard shortcuts</a> are available, which make browsing much more efficient. In particular, experiment with the mouse shortcuts for panning and zooming. To <b>pan</b>, simply <strong>click and drag</strong> any track. To <b>zoom</b>, simply use your <strong>scrollwheel</strong> (if available) or <strong>hold Ctrl/Cmd while clicking and dragging on a region</strong>.
</p>
<h4>By cytogenetic band</h4>
<p>
	Directly beneath the aforementioned navigation controls is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics">cytogenetic</a> representation of the current chromosome. For assemblies for which cytogenetic information is unavailable, no bands are shown. The current range that is being shown in the browser is highlighted on the band in blue. You can perform coarse navigation using this band by <strong>clicking on it</strong> to keep your current scale or by <strong>clicking and draggin on it</strong> to select a new position and scale.
</p>
<h4>By gene name</h4>
<p>
	Ironically, the <a href="http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ESPN">ESPN gene is related to deafness</a>. The espin gene (<b>Gene ID: &quot;ESPN&quot;</b>) is located on the q-arm of chromosome 1, at <b>chr1:6,484,846-6,521,004</b>. You can navigate directly to this and other gene regions of the genome by simply <b>entering the Gene ID in the location field</b> and pressing <b>Go</b>.
</p>
<h3>Customizing the interface</h3>
<p>
	Each track in Savant is an independent module whose view can be adjusted. You can <b>resize</b> a track by clicking on the bottom separator and dragging it up or down. You can <b>reorder</b> tracks by clicking on their title bars and dragging them to a new location. You can also perform the following actions via buttons located on each title bar:
</p>
<ul>
	<p>
		<b>maximize/restore</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>auto-hide/pin </em></b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>close</b>
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	<b>Note:</b> Some users experience difficulty pinning a minimized track. In most instances, this occurs because a user clicks on the tab instead of hovering over the tab and clicking the appropriate button on the title bar. Alternatively, you can right-click on the tab and uncheck &quot;Auto Hide&quot;.
